# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

*The purpose of this project was to be able to show we can successfully be able to analyze and convert the data so it can be easier to read. We had to show we could convert specific data in the Kick Starter data set into pivot tables, line charts, and Column charts. We also had to pull data from the Kick Starter data into new sheet and create new data with the COUNTIFS function. 
  
## Analysis and Challenges
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

*The Analysis I made were with the corresponding images and data. Some challenges I encountered were getting the functions correct, for example the COUNTIFS function. I had to make sure everything was included and accurate. Make the charts correspond with the data of my choosing was also a difficult task, I had to play around with the placements to figure out where the data should go
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 
*The two conclusions I can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Dates is that the most successful time the theater had in May and that the theater has zero to no cancelations.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

* What I can conclude about the Outcomes based on goals is that there were 0% cancelations and that the 45000 to 4999 had the highest fails.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

* Some limitations of this data set are not knowing the date of the outcomes in the Outcomes Based on Goals Chart.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

* Some of the possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are columns, pie chart, and bar graphs
